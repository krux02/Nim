The goal of this compiler fork is to create a refactored bare bones
version of Nim where I can can respond faster to bug
reports. Deprecated features won't stay for long. The goal is to
remove all WTFs from the codebase.

* TODO
** inject base type fields into node (make iterating fields easier).
** DONE use nnkTupleConstr consistently (replace nnkPar where necessary)
** raise error on union at compile time
** add entry to tutorial about init pattern (inheritable types should provide init and newMyType)
** rename down cast / up cast
** new statement: ~includedFrom "foo.nim"~ ~template includedFrom(x: string) = discard~
** nimi for included nim files
** deprecated flag on export statements (non breaking pattern to change module of something)
** generic typedesc T should not be visible anymore in the getImpl of generic instantiations.
** getImpl warning when it is not used on proc template macro symbols.
** deprecate ~pro new[T](var T): void~
** Generic ~==~ for Object Variants
** forbid/warn overload ~foobar(arg: untyped)~ ~foobar(arg: int)~
** forbid defining magic procs in user code.
** test for tensors
** validate links in nimdoc automatically
** cleanup system.nim
*** ensure automatically that all compilation branches js C C++ define the same set of symbols
*** move cint, cfloat, cstring to ctypes.nim ("compatible string" WTF!?)
*** move/create jsNumber, jsString, jsObject to jstypes.nim
*** remove unsigned (%) operators
** support ~toOpenArray~ in the VM
** fix crash on ~seq[MySimdType]~
** document cast behavior for different sized integers in the spec
** Refactor nkPostfix export marker and backticks around identifiers into flags on identifiers.
** default pattern for module test
** allow conversion of ~seq[byte](mystring)~ and ~string(mySeqofBytes)~.
** make every path relative to the current file (helper for it)
** move documentation comments to identifier/symbol properties
** move export marker to identifier/symbol properties
** remove MyType.field access
** getTypeInst, getTypeImpl fix needs a better/compatible solution.
** inconsistency, getType: (BracketExpr (Sym "ref") ...) vs. getTypeInst  (RefTy ...)
** provide ~getTypeInstSkipAlias~ as substitution of ~typetraits.genericParams~
** fix ~proc len*[TOpenArray: openArray|varargs](x: TOpenArray): int~ (WTF)
** consistent argument names in stdlib functions
** allow builtins to be macros (suits semantics better)
** WTF is ~type Foo[T: static typedesc] = object~ supposed to mean?
** make every test runable with ~testament run file.nim~ from any directory
** require full path names in ~nim c myfile.nim~
** refactor unittests module to not use local templates anymore
** remove any knowlege about nimble from the compiler
** refactor typetraits. Move sizeof/alignof to typetraits. Ensure all typetraits do have a macro API.
** restrict usage of typedesc https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/11959
** remove language feature "bind many"
** callsite as experimental https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/11864
** revisit how nodes get their line information
** change ~enforceVoidContext~ to ~tyVoid~
** fix parser to read negative literals
** fix literals of type ~int~
** Tutorial, Nim for C++ Developers: class type member -> template with typedesc argument
** full c lib wrapper
